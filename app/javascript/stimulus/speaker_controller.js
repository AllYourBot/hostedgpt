  // is ready. If so, it starts playing it. Otherwise, it sets waitingForNextPlaybackValue to true.
  //
  // The next time a playbackOutlet connects, if we are waitingForNextPlaybackValue then we start it. If not,
  // we can safely do nothing because as soon as the playback controller finishes it'll let this speaker
  // controller know (i.e. playbackFinishedPrompting).

  // There are two edge cases to consider:
  //
  // 1. When an old conversation loads (i.e. there are already assistant messages), we treat these as if they
  // all just finished being spoken. If the user decides to activate the microphone then we set
  // waitingForNextPlaybackValue to true and wait for a new playbackOutlet connect. We're in the normal loop.
  //
  // There situation calls playbackOutletConnected() repeatedly so we have a special branch in there for this
  // and we composer calls:

  micActivated() {
    this.waitingForNextPlaybackValue = true
  }

  // 2. When a new converation was just created with voice, the page will navigate from /new to /conversation
  // and re-initialize this speaker controller. We'll already have an assistant message on the page but this
  // one has not been spoken so we need to start speaking it. We can tell this case by checking the mic state:

  initialize() {
    console.log(`speaker connected with index initially ${this.playedbackIdValue} and Listener ${Listener.enabled}`)
    if (Listener.enabled) this.waitingForNextPlaybackValue = true
  }

  // 3. When the mic is disabled and a message continues to stream, we stop any playback immediately and mark
  // the full message as spoken so if the mic is re-enabled it will not re-speak any of this message.
