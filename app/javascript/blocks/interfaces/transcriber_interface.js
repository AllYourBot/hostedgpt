// the length of time we pause before reflecting on what was said should
// take into account *what* was said. If the last word was clearly the end
// of a sentence and it ended as a question? e.g. "..., right?" We should
// start considering those words sooner than if the last word is the sound
// of someone's voice trailing off. e.g. "... well..."

// For now, we have a hard-coded silence duration. Maybe we utter a sound
// like "hmm" before this silence duration has elapsed to help it feel more
// responsive? Also, maybe we start processing the response even before
// this duration has elapsed but we delay responding?
